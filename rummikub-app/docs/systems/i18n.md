Overview
This document describes the full internationalization system for the web application using i18next.
It supports more than 10 languages, automatic language detection, and dynamic namespace loading.

Objectives

Provide full multilingual support

Automatically detect the user’s language

Load translation namespaces dynamically

Persist language preference in localStorage

Comply with WCAG accessibility standards

Spanish (es)

Portuguese (pt)

French (fr)

German (de)
