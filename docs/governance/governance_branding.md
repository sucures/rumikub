# RUMI ONE — Branding Governance Framework

## 1. Purpose
This framework defines how the sovereign visual identity of RUMI ONE is governed, protected, and maintained across the ecosystem.

## 2. Immutable Identity
The following assets are sovereign and cannot be changed:
- public/branding/rumi_one_sovereign_emblem.png
- public/branding/rumi_one_design_notes.txt

These assets define the official R1 identity.

## 3. Authority
Only explicit institutional approval can authorize:
- Any modification to branding rules
- Any new visual asset
- Any exception to the identity policy

No contributor or AI system may alter the identity without approval.

## 4. Required Compliance
All systems, contributors, and documentation must:
- Use the Sovereign Seal as the only official identity
- Reference it via RUMI_ONE_EMBLEM_PATH
- Follow the design rules in rumi_one_design_notes.txt
- Maintain consistency across the five institutional files

## 5. Enforcement
Cursor must:
- Apply the identity rules automatically
- Stop and request confirmation if a task risks altering the emblem
- Maintain the integrity of institutional files

## 6. Audit Procedure
Periodic audits must verify:
- No alternate logos exist
- No unauthorized assets are used
- All references point to the correct emblem path
- Metadata and documentation remain aligned

## 7. Amendments
Any change to this governance framework requires:
- Institutional review
- Explicit approval
- Versioned documentation update

## 8. Final Note
This governance framework ensures that the RUMI ONE identity remains sovereign, consistent, and protected across all layers of the ecosystem.
