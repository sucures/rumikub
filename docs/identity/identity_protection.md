# RUMI ONE — Identity Protection Protocol

## Purpose
This document defines the protection mechanisms for the sovereign identity of RUMI ONE (R1).  
Its goal is to ensure that the visual identity remains pure, immutable, and institutionally consistent.

## Immutable Core
The following assets form the core of the identity and must never be altered:
- rumi_one_sovereign_emblem.png
- rumi_one_design_notes.txt

These files represent the official and permanent Sovereign Seal.

## Protection Rules
1. No regeneration, reinterpretation, or redrawing of the emblem.
2. No alternate versions or stylistic variations.
3. No replacement of the emblem in any context.
4. No destructive optimization or compression.
5. No use outside official or institutional contexts.

## Required Usage
The Sovereign Seal must be used for:
- Token metadata
- Wallet UI
- Institutional documentation
- Official websites and interfaces

## Enforcement Mechanism
Cursor and all contributors must:
- Use RUMI_ONE_EMBLEM_PATH for all references.
- Follow the design rules in rumi_one_design_notes.txt.
- Stop and request explicit approval if any task risks altering the emblem.

## Governance
Any proposed change to the identity must undergo:
- Institutional review
- Explicit approval
- Documentation update

## Final Statement
The Sovereign Seal is the anchor of the RUMI ONE identity.  
Its protection is mandatory and permanent.
